# A Parcel library cookiecutter project
This cookie cutter is for **browsers**.


The targets can be tweaked to compile for *node.js* as per
the [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/features/targets/) doc.


This is a repo that is intended to be *forked*.
```
git clone --bare https://github.com/kennygomdori/parcel-lib-cookiecutter.git <project-name>
